### ⚙️ Workflow Overview
1.        Data Collection
Gather urban datasets (traffic, land use, population) from open data sources.
2.        Data Processing & Analysis
Use Python libraries to clean, process, and visualize trends.
3.        Mobility Simulation
Implement SUMO to simulate traffic conditions and study bottlenecks.
4.        3D Urban Visualization
Build a simple 3D model to visually represent the urban design proposal.
5.        Optimization & Presentation
Analyse outcomes, refine the plan, and present results via visuals and reports.
